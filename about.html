		  		<p>The aim of this project work has been to visualize the data about home utilities(electricity, hot water, cold water) consumtion over a period of time.</p>
		  		<p>Based on the source data and the assignment, I have started by contructing the visualization pipeline(Fig.1) for a better understanding of the process and as a reference for the ongoing work.</p>
		  		<p>The innitial data(Raw) contained a variety of values for different time periods and also with a different step. For this particular visualization I have focused on a two months hourly data. </p>
		  		<p>The values for each of the selected utilities was in separate files, therefore I have applied some data transformation by merging it into one structure that could be further used as a source for the visualization(data tables).</p>

				</p>
		  		<p> My goal was to visualize the data in a way that will allow comparison between different utilities, however plotting on the same axis values of different types could create confusion. Therefore was needed a way of converting the data to be of the same type. I have chosen to represent the consumed data by the amount of expenses that it actually causes, which would facilitate the comparison between different values. For this I have multiplied the value of each utility to it's most recent cost(in Stockholm.)
		  		</p>
		  		<p>The price conversion is as follows</p>
		  		<ul>
		  			<li>Electrcity price = 1.2 SEK per kW</li>
		  			<li>Cold Water price = 18 SEK per kW</li>
		  			<li>Warm Water price = 48 SEK per kW</li>
		  		</ul>

		  		<p>The resulting visualization is presented bellow (Figure 2). Each of the utilities expenses are color coded as follows:</p>
		  		<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
		  			<li> <span style="color:yellow;">Electrcity expense</span></li>
		  			<li> <span style="color:blue;">Cold Water expense</span></li>
		  			<li> <span style="color:red;">Warm Water expense</span></li>
		  		</ul>
		  		<p style="text-align:center;">

				</p>

		  		<p>In the center of the chart, is a pulsating gradient that indicated if for this specific day any of the utilities expenses are higher that their corresponsing average values. In Figure 2 for instance the expense of electricity is higher that the average dayly expenditure, so the pulsating gradient is yellowish , which signifies that. In the center of the graph is indicated the current date and week day.

		  		<p>	Another purpose of the project has been to create a piece of art that would combine an ambient visualization of information with art, which I have tried to achieve through a minimalistic design and smooth transitions. You can enjoy the resulting
